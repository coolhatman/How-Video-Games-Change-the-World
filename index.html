<h2>Positive Stories About Video Games</h2>
<h3>Ashly Burch</h3>
<p2>On September 14, 2011, Ashly Burch, popular YouTuber from the YouTube channel “Hey Ash: Whatca Playin'", made a blog called “How video games saved my life”.  It was made for people to tell their story about how playing video games helped get though something. There are countless people who told their story about how they were saved. The story ranges from finding and embracing their heritage, and overcoming drug addiction. <a href="https://gamessavedmylife.tumblr.com/post/22370147585/how-video-games-saved-me-from-drugs" target="_blank">One of the stories on here, posted 11 years ago was from Kyle.</a> 

<br>
<br> 

Kyle was 17 when he tried weed for the first time. He liked it, and since he was in college, he decided to try other drugs. He tried a miriade of drugs, like alchohol and LSD. And over the next 2 years, he tried most drugs exepct meth and crack. But the one that stood out to him the most were painkillers.

<br>
<br>

He ended up getting addicted and it was very hard on him. He lost everything, and ended up selling drugs to support his addiction, and got arrested. Thankfully, one of his friends ended up convincing him to give up drugs and get treatment. He saw a doctor but he was pretty bad, so he saw a better one. Kyle says that the hardest things about the recovery is to stay clean. The people helping said that the best way to get over drug addiction to fill the hole thay drugs once did. And for him it was video games.

<br>
<br>

He played various games, like Minecraft, Borderlands, Mass Effect, GTAIV, and many more. He says,"They literally saved my life, and there is no doubt in my mind that if I didn’t have gaming to fill my time I would have long ago been back to using drugs. Thank you Games." It is unknown where Kyle is today, as the only other thing he released was a song that he posted at the end of his post. I hope he is doing well for himself.
